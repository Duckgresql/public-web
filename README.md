# Duckgresql — Public Website

Source for the **Duckgresql** public site: [duckgresql.cloud](https://duckgresql.cloud).

## What is Duckgresql?

**Duckgresql** is a SaaS platform that combines **DuckDB** and **PostgreSQL** in one service — unified SQL access to DuckDB for analytics and PostgreSQL for transactional workloads.

- **DuckDB** — OLAP: embedded analytical database, columnar storage, massively parallel processing, SQL with zero setup.
- **PostgreSQL** — OLTP: ACID transactions, row-based storage, rich ecosystem and extensions, proven reliability at scale.

**Duckgresql = DuckDB + PostgreSQL** in a single, fully managed platform.

## Highlights

- **Unified SQL interface** — Same SQL for analytics and transactions; no separate dialects or connection management.
- **Real-time sync** — Automatic synchronization between DuckDB and PostgreSQL.
- **Performance** — DuckDB for 10–100× faster analytical queries; PostgreSQL for reliable OLTP.
- **Fully managed** — Scaling, backups, security, and maintenance handled for you.
- **Enterprise security** — SOC 2 compliant, encryption at rest and in transit, RBAC, audit logs.
- **Easy integration** — Standard PostgreSQL drivers; works with existing tools and ORMs.

## Use cases (from the site)

- **Analytics dashboards** — Real-time dashboards on live transactional data without impacting production.
- **Mobile app backends** — PostgreSQL for user data and transactions; DuckDB for analytics.
- **Data warehouse alternative** — Cost-effective analytics on operational data; no ETL required.
- **AI/ML feature store** — Store training data in PostgreSQL, compute features with DuckDB, serve predictions in one platform.
